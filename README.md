# git-analyze.sh

Tools for analyzing a git repository and creating gnuplot graphes with the data.

No bloated websites or PDF generator bullshit. Each tool is one script,
following the UNIX-Philosophy as hard as I can.

I'm neither a sh/bash professional nor a gunplot specialist, so some of the
scripts might look ugly to you. But they work. PRs for improving them are
really welcome!
